# Introduction
DotsFisher is an experimental fishing-style game aimed at achieving efficient computation of large numbers of fish and bullets.  

Traditional object-oriented programming (OOP) becomes inefficient when handling a large number of objects. This project explores the use of Unity DOTS to significantly improve performance.

# Features
- [ ] Efficient simulation of massive numbers of fish and bullets  
- [ ] Freely controllable player boat  
- [ ] Vast open ocean environment
